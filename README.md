# Analysis of Ramen Ratings

In this project I analyse over 2500 ramen ratings

The dataset is taken from the webpage: https://www.kaggle.com/residentmario/ramen-ratings

The following data was used for analysis: review, brand, variety, style, country, stars and top ten.

The main library used for analysis is Pandas.
